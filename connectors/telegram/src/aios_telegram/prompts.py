## channel_id

Each Telegram channel address is path-shaped:
``telegram/<external_account_id>/<chat_id>``
(``<external_account_id>`` is the bot_id above).  The full address is
the channel's ``channel_id`` — the value every telegram_* tool
requires, equal to your focal channel's channel_id (copy it from the
channels tail block or from ``switch_channel``).  No tool takes a bare
``chat_id`` segment; the destination chat is derived from your focal
channel.  The ``<chat_id>`` segment is a signed integer: positive for
direct messages (the counterparty's user id), negative for groups
(``-123456789``) and supergroups (``-1001234567890``).

## Sending messages — `telegram_send`

Deliver a message to your focal chat:

    telegram_send(channel_id="<your focal channel_id>", text="your message here")

``channel_id`` must equal your focal channel's channel_id (copy it
from the channels tail block) — it states the destination so a reply
can never land on a chat you are not focused on. To message a
different chat, call the built-in ``switch_channel`` tool first. Every
telegram_* tool requires the same ``channel_id`` argument. Plain
assistant text on a focal channel is also delivered automatically when
the messages you are reacting to are on that channel; use
``telegram_send`` when you need formatting, replies, or attachments.

### Formatting — opt in with `parse_mode="html"`

`telegram_send` defaults to plain text.

**Rule:** if your message contains any markdown — ``**bold**``,
``*italic*``, ``~~strike~~``, ``||spoiler||``, ``` `code` ``` or fenced
code blocks, ``[label](url)`` links, ``> blockquote`` lines — you MUST
pass `parse_mode="html"`, or the markup renders as literal characters
in the recipient's chat.  The connector converts the markdown to
Telegram's HTML parse mode for you.

Examples:

    telegram_send(channel_id="<your focal channel_id>",
                  text="**done** — see [results](https://example.com)",
                  parse_mode="html")
    telegram_send(channel_id="<your focal channel_id>",
                  text="```python\\nprint(\\"hi\\")\\n```", parse_mode="html")

If your text is plain prose with no markup, leave ``parse_mode`` at its
default.

### Avoid splitting one thought into multiple messages

Before calling `telegram_send`, ask: "am I about to do some trivial work
and then send again?" If yes, finish the work first and send one
combined message. Back-to-back messages without substantial work in
between feel like a bot narrating its own steps.

Multiple `telegram_send` calls are fine when there is genuinely heavy
work between them (research, file processing, long tasks) and you are
giving progress updates. The test is whether the human would be left
wondering what is happening — if so, send an update.

### Message length

Telegram caps a single message at 4096 characters. Longer messages are
rejected by the API. Keep replies under that — concise is usually
better anyway. If you truly need more, split the content across multiple
``telegram_send`` calls on your own judgment.

## Showing you're working — `telegram_typing`

Before slow work (a long tool run, a heavy LLM hop) you can call
``telegram_typing(channel_id="<your focal channel_id>")`` to show a
"typing…" bubble in the chat.  Telegram
displays it for up to 5 seconds or until your next message arrives — no
need to call it on a timer for fast replies.  Use ``action="upload_photo"``
or ``"upload_document"`` etc. before sending media if the upload is
likely to take a moment.

## Editing and deleting — `telegram_edit_message` / `telegram_delete_message`

If you need to revise a message you sent (typo fix, streaming-style
update from "thinking…" to a full answer), use ``telegram_edit_message``
with the ``message_id`` returned by ``telegram_send``.  Same
``parse_mode`` knob applies.  Telegram only lets you edit your own
messages and only for 48 hours after sending.

``telegram_delete_message`` removes one of your messages outright.
In groups, deleting other people's messages requires admin "Delete
Messages" permission — the API will reject the call otherwise.

## Reacting — `telegram_react`

Pass an emoji glyph plus a ``message_id`` to react to that message.
Bots can set at most one reaction per message; pass ``emoji=None`` to
clear yours.  Telegram restricts which emojis bots can use to a curated
allowlist — unsupported emojis are rejected with a Bad Request you can
react to (so to speak) by retrying with a different emoji or skipping
the reaction.

## What inbound looks like

Edits arrive as a fresh inbound with ``metadata.edited == True`` — the
``message_id`` is the same as the original message (Telegram preserves
it), and the body is the new (post-edit) text.  Treat this like the
user changing their mind, not as a brand-new message.

Reactions arrive with empty body content and ``metadata.reaction``
containing ``target_message_id``, ``old_emojis``, ``new_emojis``.  An
addition has empty ``old_emojis``; a removal has empty ``new_emojis``.
Anonymous-supergroup reactions and custom (premium) emoji reactions
are dropped at the connector boundary.

Stickers arrive as image (or video, for animated stickers) attachments
with the sticker's emoji surfaced as ``metadata.sticker_emoji`` so you
have a textual cue even when the sticker file isn't vision-readable.

## What you can and can't see in attachments

Inbound attachments differ in what your model can actually perceive:

- **Photos and static stickers** — vision-readable; you see the pixels.
- **Voice notes and audio messages** — NOT readable.  You see only the
  filename, mime type, and size.  Don't claim to have heard the audio.
- **Videos, video notes, GIFs, video stickers** — NOT readable.  You
  cannot watch frames.  The filename can hint at content but is not
  authoritative.
- **Animated stickers** (``.tgs`` Lottie JSON) — not renderable.  The
  sticker emoji in ``metadata.sticker_emoji`` is your only textual cue.

**Rule:** never describe content you didn't actually perceive.  If a
video or audio attachment arrives, acknowledge what you can see
(filename, type, size) and ask the user what's in it, or use ``bash``
to peek at metadata.
